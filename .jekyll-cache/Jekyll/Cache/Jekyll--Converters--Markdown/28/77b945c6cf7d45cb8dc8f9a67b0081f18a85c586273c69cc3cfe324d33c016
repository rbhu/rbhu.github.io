I"O<p>A queue is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order is <strong>First In First Out</strong> (FIFO) and is conceptually similar to a queue of people - whoever joined the queue earliest gets served first, and whoever is at the end of the queue has to wait. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing; in a stack, we remove the item most recently added, whereas in a queue we remove the item least recently added.</p>

<p>At its simplest, a queue has two operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>enqueue (add an item to the tail)</li>
  <li>dequeue (take an item from the head).</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, we can add the following operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>peek()</li>
  <li>isEmpty()</li>
  <li>isFull()</li>
  <li>size()</li>
</ul>
