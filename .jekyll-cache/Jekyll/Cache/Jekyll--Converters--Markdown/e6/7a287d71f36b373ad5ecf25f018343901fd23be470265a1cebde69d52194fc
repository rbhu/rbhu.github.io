I"<p>In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type which serves as a collection of elements. It serves two principal operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>push, which adds an element to the collection</li>
  <li>pop, which removes an element from the collection</li>
</ul>

<p>The order in which elements come off a stack give rise to an alternative name: <strong>last in, first out</strong> (LIFO). There may additionally be some added operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>peek, which gives access to the top of the stack without modifying it</li>
  <li>isEmpty, returns true if the stack is empty, else false</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider a stack to be like a stack of plates - the last plate you place on the pile (at the top), has to be the first one you remove - else the pile of plates may come tumbling down.</p>

<h4 id="implementations">Implementations</h4>
<p>There are two ways a stack can be implemented, by using one of the following underlying data structures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Array</li>
  <li>Linked List</li>
</ul>
