I"Ÿ<p>A queue is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order is <strong>First In First Out</strong> (FIFO) and is conceptually similar to a queue of people - whoever joined the queue earliest gets served first, and whoever is at the end of the queue has to wait. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing; in a stack, we remove the item most recently added, whereas in a queue we remove the item least recently added.</p>

<p>At its simplest, a queue has two operations: enqueue (add an item to the tail) and dequeue (take an item from the head).</p>
