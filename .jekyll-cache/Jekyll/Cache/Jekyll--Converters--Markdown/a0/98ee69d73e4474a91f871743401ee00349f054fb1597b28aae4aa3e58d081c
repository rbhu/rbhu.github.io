<p>Pointers are a fundamental part of C, and are one of the features which gices C the power and flexibility it is known for. There are various reasons pointers are used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it is the only way to express some computations (e.g. )</li>
  <li>it provides compact and efficient code</li>
  <li>it provides a very powerful tool</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, C uses pointers explicitly with arrays, structures and functions.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-a-pointer">What is a pointer?</h4>
<p>A pointer is a variable which contains the address in memory of another variable. We can have a pointer to any variable type.</p>

<p>To get the address of a variable, we use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> operator. To declare a pointer to a variable, we do the following:</p>
<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">data_type</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">pointer</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To make some more sense of this, lets look at a concrete example.</p>
<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">int</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">ptr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// ptr stores the address of x</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this example, the integer variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> is declared, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ptr</code> is declared as a pointer to an integer. We assign the address of <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> to ptr. To dereference this pointer (to get the value stored at the address), simply use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> operator on the ptr variable, as follows:</p>
<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">cout</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">ptr</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="n">endl</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// outputs 5</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It is important to note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> is used in two contexts here. In the first instance, it is used to <em>declare</em> a pointer variable, and in the second it is used to <em>dereference</em> the variable.</p>
