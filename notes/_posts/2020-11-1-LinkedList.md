title: Linked List
---
A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order isn't given by their physical placement in memory; instead, each element **points** to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represents a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains just two things: **data** and a **reference**.


## Variations
### Singly linked list
### Doubly linked list
