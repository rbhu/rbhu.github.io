I"\<p>A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order isnâ€™t given by their physical placement in memory; instead, each element <strong>points</strong> to the next. The benefit of this is that linked lists can store a (hypothetically) indefinite amount of data - as long as your computer has enough memory. This differs from arrays because arrays use contiguous storage. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represents a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains just two things: <strong>data</strong> and a <strong>reference</strong>.</p>
