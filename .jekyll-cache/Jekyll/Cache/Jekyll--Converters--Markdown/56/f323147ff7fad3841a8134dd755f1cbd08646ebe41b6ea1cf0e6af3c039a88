I"B<p>A queue is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order is <strong>First In First Out</strong> (FIFO) and is conceptually similar to a queue of people - whoever joined the queue earliest gets served first, and whoever is at the end of the queue has to wait.</p>
