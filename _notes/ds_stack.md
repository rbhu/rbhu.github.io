title: Stack
---

In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type which serves as a collection of elements. It serves two principal operations:
- push, which adds an element to the collection
- pop, which removes an element from the collection

The order in which elements come off a stack give rise to an alternative name: __last in, first out__ (LIFO). There may additionally be some added operations:
- peek, which gives access to the top of the stack without modifying it
- isEmpty, returns true if the stack is empty, else false

Consider a stack to be like a stack of plates - the last plate you place on the pile (at the top), has to be the first one you remove - else the pile of plates may come tumbling down.


#### Implementations
There are two ways a stack can be implemented, by using one of the following underlying data structures:
- Array
- Linked List
